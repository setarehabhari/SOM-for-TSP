developing a self organizing map for tsp
Self-Organizing Map is an unsupervised machine learning technique and a type of artificial neural network but is trained using competitive
learning rather than the error-correction learning (e.g., backpropagation with gradient descent) used by other artificial neural networks.

The number of lines in each test case corresponds the number of cities of that test case.
Each line contains 3 numbers i x y: this indicates that the ith city is located at position (x, y).
